# QnA-App
This is a simple app idea that is originally inspired by Stack overflow. This is a basic platform that users can sign into and ask questions which are then answered by experienced users in the platform, called experts. Any amount of users can answer questions but an answer provided by an expert will be privileged.(Given more emphasis by being highlighted or shown as the first result)
